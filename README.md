## Deployment Instructions

Steps required to deploy the project.

1.  **Prepare for Deployment:**

    *   **Set `DEBUG = False` in `serverside/chatbot_project/settings.py`**.
    *   **Configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in `settings.py`**. Add your domain or IP address to the list.
    *   **Collect static files:**

bash
            gunicorn chatbot_project.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
                    *   Configure Nginx to serve static files and proxy requests to Gunicorn.  Example Nginx configuration:

                            location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }
                location /static/ {
                    root /path/to/your/static/files;
                }



    *   **Option 2: Using a Platform-as-a-Service (e.g., Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk):**

        *   Follow the platform's specific instructions for deploying Django applications.
        *   Typically, this involves creating a `Procfile` and configuring environment variables.

3.  **Configure a Production Database:**

    *   Use a robust database system like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MariaDB.
    *   Update the `DATABASES` settings in `serverside/chatbot_project/settings.py` with the production database credentials.

4.  **Set Environment Variables:**

    *   Store sensitive information like database passwords, API keys, and secret keys as environment variables.
    *   Access these variables in `settings.py` using `os.environ.get()`.

5.  **Set up a Domain and SSL Certificate:**

    *   Configure a domain name to point to your server.
    *   Obtain and install an SSL certificate (e.g., using Let's Encrypt) to enable HTTPS.

> Provide detailed instructions for the chosen deployment platform, including any platform-specific configurations.
